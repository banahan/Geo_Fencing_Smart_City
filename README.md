# Geo_Fencing_Smart_City
A Geo Fencing solution for Smart City implementations. The Developed solution was designed to be retro-fittble into the micromobility bike's locking mechanism. The device utilised latching relays and RFID to control the locking mechanism of the bike, should the bike not be in an approved parking area the mechanism would not allow for the lock to be engaged. These 'Parking Areas' would be defined using a RFID Transmitter that would deisgned to be easy install and to match the surrounding street furniture. The purpose of this project was to reduce the potential for BleeperBikes' bikes being Â improperly parked and being considered a social menace.
